git remote is to define/add git project from server, like from github to local rep.
once this is added, you can 
{{{
     remote -v //to list remote gits
}}}
then you can git push, pull from remote like
{{{
     push -u origin master
     pull origin
}}}

another thing to note is when I try to clone OSGeo/gdal project using {
{{{
     clone https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal.git
and got the following message:
---------------------
0 [main] git 8660 fork: child -1 - forked process 4520 died unexpectedly, retry 0, exit code -1073741515, errno 11
error: cannot fork() for index-pack: Resource temporarily unavailable
fatal: fetch-pack: unable to fork off index-pack
---------------------
googling from internet resulted in a solution like
{{{
    $/usr/bin/git https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal.git
}}}
or {{{
    $ PATH=/usr/bin git clone https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal.git
}}}
both way worked
like nothing should be a problem if you really knows, eh?
